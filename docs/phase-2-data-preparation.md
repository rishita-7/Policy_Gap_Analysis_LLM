# Phase 2 – Data & Knowledge Preparation

## Objective
Prepare structured, offline reference data from the
CIS MS-ISAC NIST Cybersecurity Framework Policy Template Guide (2024)
to enable automated policy gap analysis.

## Input Documents
- CIS MS-ISAC NIST Cybersecurity Framework Policy Template Guide (2024)
- Organizational policy document (user-provided)

## Key Activities
1. Extract relevant policy requirements from the CIS MS-ISAC guide
2. Break requirements into atomic policy clauses
3. Map each clause to corresponding NIST CSF functions and categories
4. Store extracted data in a structured, machine-readable format

## Data Representation
The extracted framework data will be stored locally in:
- JSON format for structured comparison
- Plain text format for NLP preprocessing

## Outcome of Phase 2
A local, offline knowledge base of policy requirements
that serves as the benchmark for gap identification in Phase 3.
